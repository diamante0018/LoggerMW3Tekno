This repository contains code for a Logger that logs all the data of a connecting player and saves it in a .txt file inside the game directory.
The directory is called DiavoloLogs and each file inside of the folder will contain the logs ordered by date.
You can set the dvar sv_HWIDProtect in the server cfg to 1 or 0 (default is 1) to enable HWID spoofing.
This feature protects online players if someone tries to kick them or if someone tries to fill the lobby with bots (Same IP but different HWID).
